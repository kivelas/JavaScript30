JavaScript Drum Kit exercise with enhancements

The basic functionality was done based on the instructions of Wes Bos.

Some style modifications are my own as well as the button for random sound.
You can use the random button by clicking it with the mouse. As a result it will generate one 
random sound and the animation related to it.
